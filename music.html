I've been making music since the early 90's, when I figured out that my tape deck had an
echo control on the microphone input, and I could use a bare wire as a sound source. I've
evolved ever so slightly since then.

I have been a member of bands Double Leopards and Religious Knives, and the work I've been
doing in the last few years can be found <a href="https://michaelrbernstein.bandcamp.com/">on
  my bandcamp page here</a>.
