<h3>A Prayer for Peace in Palestine</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The closest I have ever come to living in a war zone was waking up across the river from the World Trade Center in Queens on September 11th, 2001 at around 11AM. </p>

<p>I open my curtain and the sky is bright blue. Very few clouds. I stretch and sit in front of my computer. Turn on the screen. It’s covered with Instant Messages. </p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“Are you okay?"<br/>
"Where are you?"<br/>
"Dude???”<br/>
"Bro grab your AK, we’re at war!"<br/>
“Call me"<br/></i>
<p></p>
<p>I looked around for my small blue Nokia cell phone. Sweatily I grab it. </p>
<p>Voicemails but no reception. No way to hear them. </p>
<p>My heart is a distraction, I want to talk to someone. </p>
<p>No land line and the internet is slow.</p>
<p>All I smell is cigarettes and stale beer. I open a window.</p>
<p>My roommate is at work. </p>
<p>I turn on the television.</p>
<p></p>

<p>What does it mean to be from a place? </p>
<p>What does the world owe you, and what do you owe the world, because of the coordinates of your emergence from the womb?  </p>
<p>Were you born from a person or born from the earth?</p>
<p></p>

<p>I was born and learned that we share a God. I was born and learned that we share a God and share blood and are a family. I was born and learned that we share a God and share blood and are a family and some people are not in this family. I was born and learned that we share a God and share blood and are a family and some people are not in this family and we must keep them away from our own. I was born and learned that we share a God and share blood and are a family and some people are not in this family and we must keep them away from our own.</p>
