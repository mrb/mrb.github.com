### Programming, Math, and Hot Dogs

Programming is like eating a hot dog: you don't have to know what it's made of to enjoy it, and in fact it may even detract from your experience. <b>[1][2]</b>

<b>Notes:</b> 

<b>[1]</b> Math. Programming is made of math. That's the joke.<br/>
<b>[2]</b> On the other hand, some people take pleasure in knowing where their food comes from, understanding that even scraps have a home somewhere.
