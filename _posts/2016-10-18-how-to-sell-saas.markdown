### How to Sell SaaS

When I decided to start trying to sell my services as someone with unique insight into and experience with marketing and selling software to developers, a thought occurred to me: I should probably <a href="http://michaelrbernste.in/2014/10/21/should-i-read-papers.html">back my experiences up with some research</a>. I had read some papers relating to understanding customer behavior and revenue patterns, and delved a bit into the statistics and theory behind the KPI measurements that startups tend to rely on, but I hadn't done much searching for research about sales and marketing. I wondered what was out there.

After some searching, I came across a nice paper titled <a href="http://users.jyu.fi/~pttyrvai/papers/Selling_SaaS_prerelease.pdf">"How to Sell SaaS: A Model for Main Factors of Marketing and Selling Software-as-a-Service"</a> by Pasi Tyrväinen and Joona Selin. In it, the authors develop and refine a model for understanding the important components of marketing and sales in a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business model. This paper interests me because helping companies <a href="http://tomtunguz.com/are-you-spending-enough-time-gtm/">develop go to market strategies</a> is on the top of my list of projects I'm conquering with <a href="http://computermodern.io">Computer Modern</a>.

After some reflection, I realized that the reason this paper appealed to me is because it helps to do one of my favorite things in an elegant way: it breaks down a large, messy subject into constituent parts, backed by research to bolster its claims. Papers which provide overviews of existing disciplines are always interesting to me, and I look forward to reading more deeply in this area.

The authors are out to achieve a few basic goals in this paper:

> "Our purpose is to initiate academic research on marketing and selling SaaS by presenting a model of the key factors for marketing and selling SaaS and related key performance indicators (KPI)."

Now that's what I'm talking about. It's great to see work aimed at taking situations where most people go on gut, and attempting to transform that into a more scientific, data-driven approach. All too often in my career I have made the mistake of assuming too much without bothering to check details, and I've seen other leadership do the same. This paper is definitely a step in the right direction.

In this post I'll pull out some of the more pertinent aspects of the paper to the work I'm doing with <a href="http://computermodern.io">Computer Modern.</a> Since I can't cover it all, I hope you'll read the paper in full and tell me what your thoughts are.

#### Definition of SaaS

One of the more useful components of academic work is its ability to provide definitions for complex ideas. Though the definition of SaaS as provided by the authors may not be complete or accurate for every case, it's a great starting point, and a useful one if you're explaining the concept to someone who is not familiar with it. SaaS is, according to the paper:

* Software is used with a Web browser or other thin client making use of standard internet protocol.
* A standardized software product is provided with no customization.
* There is no need to install software to the customer site.
* Deployment requires no major integration or installation.
* Customers pay for use of the software rather than licenses.
* The same multitenant installation is provided for several customers.

It's interesting to see how this definition contrasts with one you might put together - this can definitely be an enlightening exercise.

#### An initial model

The heart of this paper is an attempt to model the factors which

Refinement

#### An evidence-based approach

Section 4 of the paper documents the authors multi-case study, where they survey a number of Finnish startups in order to see how the companies actually function with respect to the initial model the authors created.

#### The big picture

Bringing it all together

> "The dominant factor to determine the target group of customers was the number of potential users, which is directly related to the headcount of the customer organization."

> "The main sales channel was direct personal sales supported with Internet-based marketing communication. Internet as such was not much used as a sales channel, and advertising was not used in marketing communication."

> "The most important performance indicator for marketing and sales was customer acquisition cost."

> "Customer lifetime value and churn were the key performance indicators for customer relationship management."

> "The SaaS providers also share challenges of professional service providers in maintaining customer relationships and avoiding customer churn. Finding a marketing and sales approach matching these combined challenges originating from of both software product and professional services business will be critical to success of any SaaS firm in the near future."
