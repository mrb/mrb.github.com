### Yeah, but what are you gonna make?

I love to tell people about the things I'm interested in and learning. Often, when I'm talking to someone about what I'm currently obsessed with, they'll ask me:

> "Yeah, but what are you gonna make?"

Usually, I'm not gonna make anything.

And I'm okay with that.

And you should be okay with it too.

Since you never know how what you learn now will impact what you do in the future, only learning for the sake of making doesn't work for everyone. If you learn by doing, then do! But don't be afraid to make and publish your toys and experiments.

Actually, don't be afraid at all. Fear sucks.
