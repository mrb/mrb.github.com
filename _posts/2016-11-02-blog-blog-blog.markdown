### Yes, your team should be blogging

I tweet a lot. Enough that when one particular tweet gets more attention than others, it makes me wonder why. Today, that happened with this tweet:

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An engineering blog with actual things that actual engineers have shipped is the best recruiting tool there is /c <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11">@patio11</a></p>&mdash; mrb (@mrb_bk) <a href="https://twitter.com/mrb_bk/status/793778579515510785">November 2, 2016</a></blockquote>

I'm hoping that a good number of people saw this tweet and agreed, and that's why they told me they "loved" it, or Retweeted it. I started to think about the reasons why your **developer-facing** company should be blogging, and realized that recruiting is only one of them. So, I decided to take my own advice and blog.

Here are 10 more reasons why *technical blogging should be just as important to your team as feature development or fixing bugs*:

* It helps with quality assurance - if you're speaking out about it publicly, you'll go the extra mile to make sure its battle tested
* It helps create a rhythm around shipping
* It signals to the outside world that the company behind the product is highly-functioning, and that people are excited about and invested in their work
* It shines a spotlight on individuals or teams within a company who don't typically get enough recognition
* It helps diversify the voice of a company and its audience as a company grows
* The best marketing communication is *helpful* and *authentic*, and being a developer writing to an audience of developers makes great writing that much easier to pull off
* It helps promote technical ideas and Open Source projects that might otherwise have a hard time gaining momentum
* It explicitly involves technical individuals in the revenue side of the business, something that is sorely needed in B2B startups
* It helps outsiders understand products that they love to use
* It lets you brag about how amazing your team is

...and I'm sure there are many more.

In addition to blogging, your team should be **giving talks**, and **documenting**, and **contributing to evergreen resources**, and a lot of other things, but start with blogging. In my opinion, there are few things with a better ROI for developer marketing and community growth.
