* My name is Michael Bernstein and this is “The Perfect Programming Language”
* I’m very excited to be here giving the opening talk of CodeConf 2016
* Thank you to all of the organizers for having me and to you for being here

* A little bit about me!
* I work for a company called Code Climate - we’re a hosted static analysis platform dedicated to making it easier for teams to write high quality software together - ask me for more information at the conference if that sounds interesting to you
* I recently finished co-authoring a book about making pizza at home
* And I’m an amateur potter!
* All of which is to say, I’m clearly eminently qualified to be addressing you about the perfect programming language

* We don’t have a lot of time and I’ve really been looking forward to telling you this story, so let’s get started
* It begins as a lot of my stories do, with me digging through a pile of junk
* Because I spend a lot of time digging through junk

* So anyway, one day when I was digging through a pile of junk, I found one of my favorite things to find when I’m digging through a pile of junk: A box of records

<img src='/images/ppl/pplslides.005.jpeg'><br/>

* Inside that box of records was something that I didn’t expect to find: a notebook
* And inside that notebook were things that I really, really,  really didn’t expect to find

Not to mention that this was not a normal box of records by any means
A normal box of records you find in a pile of junk is usually terrible and mostly composed of very old unplayable classical albums
This particular box, however, included, in addition to a lot of other very high quality jazz records, one of my favorite records of all time

Ok so back to the notebook. In a lot of ways it was an ordinary notebook - one of those marble covered jobs like I used to use in middle school
But I knew this wasn’t a typical notebook when I pulled it out and looked more closely at the cover

It read, in neat handwriting, “The Perfect Programming Language” by J. Piano
You can imagine my astonishment here - as someone who is both into Sun Ra and programming languages, it seemed beyond unbelievable that there was someone else in the world who was interested in both
I felt I had found a kindred spirit in this mysterious “J. Piano”

So I opened the notebook up, and read this curious dedication which was written in a language I didn’t recognize at first, so I pasted it into Google translate

<img src='/images/ppl/pplslides.010.jpeg'><br/>

And it came back with this
A dedication, in ESPERANTO, to Borges, Sun Ra, and McCarthy? Three of my favorite people from history? This was getting a little ridiculous
Since not everyone will know who these folks are, and it’s important to the story, I’ll give you a brief introduction to each

Sun Ra, whose record I also found in that box, is one of the greatest jazz composers and performers of all time
Unfathomably prolific and original, uncompromising, and literally not of this world
