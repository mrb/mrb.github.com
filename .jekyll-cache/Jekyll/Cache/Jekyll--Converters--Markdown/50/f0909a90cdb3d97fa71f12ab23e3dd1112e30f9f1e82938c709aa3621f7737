<h3 id="sales-for-engineers-1-50">Sales For Engineers, 1-50</h3>

<p>In my capacity as a software engineer for the last 7 years or so, I‚Äôve done all kinds of interesting things. Recently, I‚Äôve dove into sales and sales engineering at my <a href="http://codeclimate.com">new gig</a>. I found that acquiring customers and understanding their behavior is very challenging, and is also a lot of fun. The typical attitudes held by software engineers about sales are shitty at best, uninformed at worst. I‚Äôm here to tell a different side of the story and hopefully offer some advice that will get people excited. If you like this list, I‚Äôll make another one.</p>

<p><em>Note that this list comes from my experiences of selling a Business-to-Business Software as a Service product. It may not pertain to everyone, but it should be entertaining and informative nonetheless.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Sales matters. Embrace it now, you‚Äôll be better off in the long run because you‚Äôll understand how shit works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you won‚Äôt put time and effort in to understand sales, how can you expect people to do so with technology?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don‚Äôt take being a ‚Äúcost center‚Äù personally. Actually just kidding, that shit is offensive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.springer.com/statistics/computational+statistics/book/978-0-387-79053-4">Learn some statistics</a> for the love of Edsger.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You already know everything about computers, programming, software engineering, etc, so why not something new?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measure everything. I‚Äôm going to say this a couple times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understand your customer because that is who you build your software for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything you build is in service of the customer, no matter how invisible to you they are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A qualified lead is a customer who is already interested.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following from #9, a qualified lead isn‚Äôt going to be annoyed when you reach out to try and help them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following from #10, you should help them by figuring out if they‚Äôre a good fit for your product.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The value in your product is in the eye of the customer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you can‚Äôt confidently sell your product at the price you sell it for, either don‚Äôt sell it, or sell it for a different price.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sales and the interaction between human beings is the ultimate distributed system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have an advantage in sales because you understand the product in a specific way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have an advantage in sales because you breathe numbers and functions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have an advantage in sales because you can see through the data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have a disadvantage in sales because you understand the product in a specific way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have a disadvantage in sales because you breathe numbers and functions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have a disadvantage in sales because you can see through the data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can make the data come to life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use tools to determine who to speak to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speak to them a lot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the telephone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seriously, use the telephone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get excited about knowing your potential customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put yourself in the position of the customer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measure everything about everything.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make graphs, not too many, mostly 95th percentiles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many trial customers do you have right now? You should know.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many trial customers are on the last day of their trial right now? You should know.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get my point? You should know a lot about your trial customers. As much as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How long is your trial? Why is it that long?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pricing is really hard, you will fuck it up at least once.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listen to your customers about pricing, but be confident in the value you provide for them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cheap products seem cheap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cheaper plans churn more quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Net churn vs. Gross churn - learn about them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There‚Äôs a lot of science in sales - <a href="http://www.brucehardie.com/papers/021/sbg_2006-05-30.pdf">check this out, for example </a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bruce Hardie is amazing. Learn about him.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do your competitors sell their product? Sell it better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sign up for new trials all the time, see how other companies do it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next time you get the opportunity to <em>take</em> a sales call, do it. See how it works from the other side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assume that your customer is interested, and help them figure out if the product is right for them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measure everything - had to say it again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Annual pricing is awesome, provide it when you can.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much does it cost you to acquire a new customer?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much does a new customer bring you in revenue?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the typical amount of recurring revenue that a customer brings you?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sales is fun. Enjoy it.</p>
  </li>
