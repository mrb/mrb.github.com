<h3 id="ill-never-stop-calling-it-the-city">I’ll never stop calling it ‘The City’</h3>

<p>I don’t have a habit of posting anything personal on this blog, but there’s room here for anything.</p>

<p>I also don’t have really have the words to express how this makes me feel to say, but here it goes: On August 1st, 2014, my family and I are moving out of New York City to pursue a new life in the Washington, D.C. area.</p>

<p>There are many factors that make this the right choice for us right now, and equally as many that make it a gut-wrenching, impossible goodbye.</p>

<p>Really, I’m not going to try and write down what it’s like to leave before I leave.</p>

<p>For my local friends, we still have plenty of time together, and I’ll be back in “the city” often.</p>

<p>Also, I’ll never stop calling it “The City.”</p>

<p>See you all soon.</p>
