<p><em>The awesome folks at <a href="http://softwaregr.org/">Software GR</a> in Grand Rapids, Michigan invited me to come and give a talk about … anything I wanted! It was quite an honor to be asked and I delivered a talk I’ve been wanting to give for a long time. I decided not to include the speaker notes this time because they’re still a work in progress. Consider this a first step towards a more well developed talk that I will give at the end of March.
